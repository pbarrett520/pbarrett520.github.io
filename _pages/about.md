When not demonstrating tech products or strategizing client relations, I dive deep into the world of coding, with a special focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP). My background as a linguist and educator, combined with a passion for integrating traditional language learning with cutting-edge technology, equips me with a unique perspective in both developing and showcasing technological solutions. This dual expertise enables me to understand and convey product value in a way that resonates deeply with diverse audiences.

**Professional Journey:**  
My six years in China, including the challenging period of Zero COVID and the Shanghai lockdown in 2022, honed my leadership skills and ability to manage diverse teams in dynamic environments. In China, I not only improved language learning outcomes but also successfully bridged cultural divides through innovative educational practices.

At Zmack! Consulting in Shanghai, I spearheaded the development of AI-driven tools for an improvised comedy show, blending advanced language models with live entertainment. This experience underscored my capability to creatively and effectively apply AI technologies in real-time settings.

**Technical and Sales Proficiencies:**
- Expert in leveraging technology to solve complex problems and enhance user experiences, particularly in educational and client-facing settings.
- Skilled in tech sales, with a proven track record of managing client relationships across multicultural environments, ensuring satisfaction and fostering long-term engagement.

**Areas of Expertise:**
- **Natural Language Processing:** Specializing in developing and promoting NLP software solutions, with hands-on experience in neural and rules-based methods for text generation, text-to-speech, sentiment analysis, tokenization, and more.
- **Education:** Committed to transforming the learning process through innovative methods that make education accessible and effective for diverse student populations.
- **Sales and Client Relations in Multicultural Environments:** Demonstrated excellence in navigating multicultural settings, driving project success and client satisfaction through tailored strategies and inclusive leadership.

**Education:**
- **Master of Science in Human Language Technology,** University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ
- **Bachelor of Arts in Applied Linguistics,** Georgia State University (Summa Cum Laude), Atlanta, GA
